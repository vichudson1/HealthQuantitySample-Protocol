# HealthQuantitySample-Protocol
A protocol oriented approach to making HKQuantity Samples easy to display in your UI.

Full example use is in the playground. The protocol and supporting extensions are in the sources folder along with a file containing the constant formatters used by the protocol, cause hey formatter creation is expensive, right. There is also a file with some sample HKQuantitySamples defined to play with in the playground.
